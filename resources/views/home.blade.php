        <p>Nowadays, it is very important for all of us to do out part in conserving energy. We may contribute in helping the environment by saving the energy in our own homes. We don’t want to utilize a lot of appliances to feel comfortable while we are inside the house for the reason that we don’t want to pay so much on our energy bill. Instead, we make sure that the insulation is functioning properly to keep us warm during the winter and feel cool when the heat is overwhelming in the summer. Insulation in its optimum function can save almost half of the energy that a typical house with no insulation utilizes.</p>
        <p>The desire to help the environment and the motivation to convert your home into an energy-efficient property will no longer be just an imagination for Fidelity Builders and Design will help you acquire proper insulation for your home. We will provide you with the ideal combination of air tightness, thermal performance, moisture management, and noise reduction properties for a completely comfortable home.</p>

        <p>

If you call us now, We will send out experts to carefully inspect your home and check for air leaks in your basement insulation, attic insulation, crawl space insulation, floor insulation, ceiling insulation and roof insulation.

        <h2 class="text-center">Comprehensive Product Line for Complete Comfort</h2>
        <p>LAAtticInsulation.com understands that every home is unique thus insulation may vary. Some homes may have multiple rooms or the house may be located in areas where it is completely exposed to the extreme changes in the weather. We offer clients our exclusive line of insulation products and these include:</p>
        <h2>Spray Foam Insulation</h2>
        <p>Spray foam insulation provides permanent insulation for your home. Open cell and closed cell spray foam insulation fill all types of cracks and opened spaces and it acts as thermal and air sealant that is definitely durable and long-lasting. Spray foam insulation also has noise-reduction properties for homeowners to achieve peace and quiet in their own homes.</p>
        <h2>Cellulose Insulation</h2>
        <p>LAAtticInsulation.com aims to conserve energy and help the environment therefore, cellulose insulation consists of 80% recycled newspaper which is suitable for our eco-friendly customers. Its construction is highly-concentrated that it has airtight sealing which is as good as spray foam insulation. Cellulose insulation may be made with recycled newspaper but it is coated with a fire-retardant to reduce its flammability. This is one type of insulation that is guaranteed safe and it truly helps the environment with its main component.</p>
        <h2>Fiberglass Insulation</h2>
        <p>If you want to have excellent thermal performance and live in a space that is really comfortable without using so much energy, fiberglass insulation is perfect for your home. LAAtticInsulation.com offers batts and rolls of blanket insulation which are suitable for the standard spacing of your floor joists, wall studs and attic trusses.</p>
